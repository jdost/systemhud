# `systemhud`

Collection of helper definitions that I use to build various HUD elements
for my system.  These interact/are used by various HUD elements like
notification daemons, statusbars, selectors, etc.  The main goal of this
is to centralize useful pieces that assemble into powerful information
displays for my systems.
